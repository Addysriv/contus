A personality test can be an important piece of the puzzle in an overall picture of the candidate - and a more honest one picture of yourself as an applicant.

label.contus.faq=FAQ
label.contus.q1=Why should I do a personality test? 
label.contus.a1=A job ad can generate hundreds of applications. To stand out, an appealing presentation is required.A good CV with qualifications and letters can show competence, but personality is just as important in the assessment. By applying with a test early in the process, an overall picture of the applicant can increase the chances of a more successful recruitment.
label.contus.q2=How reliable is the test? 
label.contus.a2=Validity and reliability are important factors to assess the reliability of a test. Validity is about measuring correctly things and reliability if the test is measured correctly. Often the selection is about future work performance and which candidate who has the best conditions to handle one certain situation. Here, the Five Factor Model can predict results with some precision, but looking at personality and human behavior in the organization can it give a much better predictor.
label.contus.q3=What will the test show? 
label.contus.a3=The results show various personality traits such as social skills, ability to work together, orderliness, resilience to stress, openness to new ideas and how the person ranks on those scales.
label.contus.q4=What can the test be used for? 
label.contus.a4=It can be used as an attractive complement to your application and be the basis for further discussion in the interview as well as in the decision-making process.
label.contus.q5=What if I am on the wrong side of the scale? 
label.contus.a5=There are no right or wrong answers, rather the test shows in which environment the person feels and performs best. The professional role of how qualities can strengthen a team should determine which personality traits are most appropriate.
label.contus.q6=How is the test assessed?
label.contus.a6=The test is a scientifically based measuring instrument that assesses the answers on a scale with two extremes in five different personality dimensions.Together, the answers form the basis of a personality.
label.contus.q7=What happens after the test is done? 
label.contus.a7=The result is displayed immediately and is also sent as a report to the registered email address. The report can then be shared with employers or recruiters.
label.contus.q8=What are soft skills? 
label.contus.a8=So-called soft skills, refer to non-technical qualities such as social competence, ability to work together and conflict management. To compare with hard skills that are based more on competence and experience.
label.contus.q9=How does the test differ from other tests on the market? 
label.contus.a9=There are many market participants and different types of tests on the market. Type tests such as DISC/DISA that divide personality traits into different groups (eg red, green, yellow, blue) do not take into account the scale between two extremes. The risk is that you see the candidate as only "blue" and miss other qualities that are highly relevant to the position. Attribute tests such as the Five Factor Model identify characteristics on a scale and provide a personality profile rather than a personality type.
